# first-portfolio

## Description

This is my first portfolio.
I made this portfolio using advanced CSS properties. My HTML file creates the basis for it,
while my CSS file gives the website style.
In this portfolio, you'll find some information about me, my work and my first application.
Using some basic and a little advanced styling skills, I have a created a webpage with a responsive UI,
with the links located at the top scrolling to the corresponding section on the webpage.
This is only my first portfolio, and with time it will become more advanced! 
Please feel free to check out my Github to keep updated on new projects I am creating!
